Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
You can install the latest release of ``armstrong.apps.streams`` using `pip`_:

::

    pip install armstrong.apps.streams

Make sure to add ``armstrong.apps.streams`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.  You
can add this however you like.  This works as a copy-and-paste solution:

::

	INSTALLED_APPS += ["armstrong.apps.streams", ]

Once installed, you have to run either ``syncdb``, or ``migrate`` if you are
using `South`_.
