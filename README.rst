tt_streams
==========
Provides a means of creating streams of content


Usage
-----
You can use the tt_streams to collect different models from different apps into
a unified stream of models.  Streams are made up of a series of ``StreamItem``
subclasses that you write that are specific to each app that they are used in.

To skip straight ahead to simple (bordering on naive) implementation examples,
check out the `project/example/models.py`_ file.

.. _project/example/models.py: https://github.com/texastribune/tt_streams/blob/master/project/example/models.py

Each Django app that wants to expose its models to streams should do two things:

* Create a specific ``*Item`` model.  For example, ``StoryItem`` should subclass
  the ``StreamItem`` model and provide a connection via a ``ForeignKey`` to the
  model that is opting in,``Story`` in this case.
* Create a way to get associate those models with a ``Stream``.  This is most
  commonly done via an inline interface to the ``StreamItem`` sub-class.

Beyond these requirements, everything else you do with your subclass of
``StreamItem`` is up to you.  It's common to use your ``StreamItem`` class as a
cache table so you don't have to send another query to the database.

For example, the ``StoryItem`` automatically stores the title of its related
``Story`` model when it is saved, and a receiver is hooked up to the ``post_save``
signal for ``Story`` to ensure that all of its ``stream_items`` are resaved each
time it is saved.

There are a couple of things to note:

* You can name your subclass of ``StreamItem`` whatever you would like
* You can name your related field whatever you like
* It automatically has a ``pub_date`` that you *can* use for ordering, but they
  are not ordered by default


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
You can install the latest release of ``tt_streams`` using `pip`_:

::

    pip install tt_streams

Make sure to add ``tt_streams`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.  You
can add this however you like.  This works as a copy-and-paste solution:

::

	INSTALLED_APPS += ["tt_streams", ]

Once installed, you have to run either ``syncdb``, or ``migrate`` if you are
using `South`_.
